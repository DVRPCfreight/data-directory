﻿BIOTA,NJ_VernalHabitat,,Polygon,NJ Vernal Habitat (Landscape Project),Peter Winkler,"In 2001, ENSP partnered with Rutgers University Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) to develop a method for mapping potential vernal pools throughout New Jersey. Through an on-screen visual interpretation of digital orthophotography, CRSSA identified over 13,000 potential pools throughout the state. A subset of these pools was field verified and confirmed, with an 88% accuracy rate, to meet the physical characteristics to qualify as a vernal pool (Lathrop et al. 2005). In accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4, the term ""vernal habitat"" includes a vernal pool - or the area of ponding - plus any freshwater wetlands adjacent to the vernal pool. Vernal habitat areas mapped in the Landscape Project rely upon those data developed by the DEP and CRSSA to identify sites that should be field checked for possible identification as vernal habitats areas. DEP staff is in the process of field-verifying these pools. The Department also maps vernal habitat areas based upon on-the-ground assessment of sites not captured by the CRSSA mapping. The Landscape Project includes all of the CRSAA-identified sites, as well as sites identified by on-the-ground reconnaissance, categorized as either ""potential vernal habitat areas"" or ""vernal habitat areas"" as defined below: "" Potential vernal habitat area - These are areas identified by CRSSA as possibly containing a vernal pool that meets the criteria of a ""vernal habitat"" pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. These sites include sites that have been field inspected and have been found to meet the physical characteristics of a vernal habitat, but for which biological criteria have not yet been measured, as well as sites that have not been checked by DEP staff. "" Vernal habitat areas - These are areas that contain pools that have been field-verified by the Department and have been determined to meet both the physical and biological characteristics of a vernal habitat in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.4. All areas mapped as ""potential vernal habitat areas"" and ""vernal habitat areas"" are derived from a point location estimated to be the center of an individual vernal pool and include all areas within 300 meters of the point. Note that the occurrence area is not intended to suggest or correspond with any specific regulatory requirement. Rather, the area added around the point accounts for variations in the size of individual vernal pools, variations in the width of freshwater wetlands adjacent to the pool, plus adjacent habitats sufficient to include the estimated home range for vernal pool obligate species. If there is an overlap between areas mapped around two or more nearby points, the boundaries are conjoined to generate contiguous patches. If the resulting patch contains areas mapped as ""vernal habitat area"" and areas mapped as ""potential vernal habitat areas,"" the entire patch is labeled as a ""vernal habitat area.""","The Landscape Project was designed to provide users with peer-reviewed, scientifically sound information that transparently documents threatened and endangered species habitat.  Landscape Project data are easily accessible and can be integrated with the planning, protection and land management programs of non-government organizations and private landowners and at every level of government- federal, state, county and municipal.  Landscape maps and overlays provide a basis for proactive planning, such as the development of local habitat protection ordinances, zoning to protect critical wildlife areas, management guidelines for imperiled species conservation on public and private lands, and land acquisition projects.  Most importantly, the information that is readily available in the Landscape Project can be used for planning purposes before any actions such as proposed development, resource extraction (e.g. timber harvests) or conservation measures occur. The maps help increase predictability for local planners, environmental commissions, and developers and help facilitate local land use decisions that appropriately site and balance development and habitat protection.  The Landscape Project maps allow the regulated public to anticipate potential environmental regulation in an area and provide some level of assurance regarding areas where endangered, threatened or species of special concern are not likely to occur, affording predictability to the application and development process.  Thus, Landscape Project maps can be used proactively by regulators, planners and the regulated public in order to minimize conflict and protect species.  This minimizes time and money spent attempting to resolve after-the-fact endangered and threatened species issues.","This data set is a product of the Landscape Project, a pro-active, ecosystem-level approach to the long-term protection of imperiled and priority species and their important habitats in New Jersey.

BIOTA,NJ_NatHeritSites,,Polygon,Natural Heritage Priority Sites,,"*DOWNLOADED AUGUST, 2007. THIS IS THE 6/5/07 UPDATE* The Natural Heritage Priority Sites Coverage was created to identify critically important areas to conserve New Jersey's biological diversity, with particular emphasis on rare plant species and ecological communities. Natural Heritage Priority Sites are based on analysis of information in the New Jersey Natural Heritage Database. However, these sites do not cover all the known habitat for endangered and threatened species in New Jersey. If information is needed on whether or not endangered or threatened species have been documented from a particular piece of land, a Natural Heritage Database search can be requested by contacting the Office of Natural Lands Management. The Natural Heritage Priority Sites coverage is a valuable tool which can be used by individuals and agencies concerned with the protection and management of land. However, the coverage was not developed for regulatory purposes, and should not be used as a substitute for the on-site surveys and Natural Heritage Database searches required by regulatory agencies.","Using the Natural Heritage Database, the Office of Natural Lands Management (ONLM) has identified 343 Natural Heritage Priority Sites, representing some of the best remaining habitat for rare species and rare ecological communities in the state. Although the primary focus of these sites is rare plant species and ecological communities, the DEP Endangered and Nongame Species Program also provided key information and assisted with the delineation of a number of the sites that encompass significant habitats for rare animals. These areas should be considered to be top priorities for the preservation of biological diversity in New Jersey. If these sites become degraded or destroyed, we may lose some of the unique components of our natural heritage. Natural Heritage Priority Site maps are used by individuals and agencies concerned with the protection and management of land. The maps have been used by municipalities preparing natural resource inventories, public and private conservation organizations preparing open space acquisition goals, land developers and consultants identifying environmentally sensitive lands, and public and private landowners developing land management plans. Natural Heritage Priority Sites contain some of the best and most viable occurrences of rare plant species and ecological communities, but they do not cover all the known habitat for these elements or most rare animal species in New Jersey.

BIOTA,NJ_MusselHabitat,,Polyline,NJ Freshwater Mussel Habitat (Landscape Project),Peter Winkler,"DEP maintains a Stream Network data layer that is a subset of the USGS 1:24,000 high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In Version 3.1 of the Landscape Project, stream and water body centerlines from the NHD Streams 2002 data layer are used to represent freshwater mussel habitat. Water body centerline and stream centerline data are valued exclusively by freshwater mussel species occurrence areas while other aquatic species habitats are represented with polygons from the Species-Based Habitat layer. In order to form representative ""patches"" of habitat from the NHD Streams 2002 layer, centerlines were broken at the following points: The confluence of two or more streams The inflow/outflow of a water body Stretches of stream intersected by a mussel SOA are valued as habitat. All valued streams are buffered by 0.75 kilometers upstream and downstream. The 0.75 kilometer distance is chosen as a conservative buffer estimate because scientific literature, which is based largely upon larval transport by host fishes, indicates that if there are two occurrences within two kilometers of each other (assuming unsuitable habitat between), these occurrences should be considered as part of the same local population (NatureServe 2011). In the cases where stream buffers of separate occurrences of the same species met, either upstream or downstream, the stream segments between those occurrences are also valued for that species. In addition, in cases where dams are barriers the extent of stream valued was limited.","The Landscape Project was designed to provide users with peer-reviewed, scientifically sound information that transparently documents threatened and endangered species habitat.  Landscape Project data are easily accessible and can be integrated with the planning, protection and land management programs of non-government organizations and private landowners and at every level of government- federal, state, county and municipal.

BIOTA,NJ_Landscape_Project,,Polygon,NJDEP's Landscape Project (v. 3.1),Peter Winkler,"The Landscape Project combines documented wildlife locations with NJDEP aerial photo-based 2007 Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) to delineate imperiled and special concern species habitat within New Jersey. Many species occurrence locations cannot be published because they may represent nest sites, roost sites, dens and other sites used by species that are vulnerable to human disturbance and, in some cases, susceptible to illegal collection. At the same time, wildlife moves, as individual animals use various habitat features within the landscape to fulfill their foraging, sheltering and breeding needs. Therefore, protecting individual occurrences or the area used by one individual is generally not sufficient to protect the local population. Landscape Project maps address these issues by displaying habitat patches that animals use and that are required to support local populations, rather than pinpointing exact locations of the most sensitive wildlife sites or simply protecting points where species happened to be observed at one point in time. Prior to combining species occurrence data with LULC data to form the habitat patches that make up the Species-Based Habitat layer, each dataset was generated according to a specific data development process.","The Landscape Project was designed to provide users with peer-reviewed, scientifically sound information that transparently documents threatened and endangered species habitat.

BIOTA,NJ_ImptBirdAreas,,Polygon,New Jersey Audubon Sociey's (NJAS) Important Bird and Birding Areas (IBBA) Program Important Bird Area (IBA) Boundaries,Crsitina Frank,"Last Updated: Feb 2010 ADVISORY: This metadata file contains information for New Jersey Audubon Sociey's (NJAS) Important Bird and Birding Areas (IBBA) Program Important Bird Area (IBA) Boundaries. There are additional reference documents listed in this file under Supplemental Information which should also be examined by users of these data sets. NJAS's IBBA Program worked closely with the Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, to develop a geographic information system (GIS)-based model to delineate IBA boundaries. The boundary for a New Jersey IBA is that area within each IBA described in the NJAS publication describing NJ's IBAs, ""New Jersey Important Bird Areas Site Guide"" (http://www.njaudubon.org/Tools2.Net/Ibba/SiteListing.aspx) and that provides habitat for the bird species or suite of bird species for which the IBA site was identified. The IBA boundary is the area that we seek to protect, enhance or restore for birds and their habitats and is therefore based on the extent and quality of wildlife habitat rather than on ownership, political boundaries or protection status. Most IBA boundaries are based on natural landscape features (wetland, forest, grassland or river); however, if the natural landscape feature is lost or not evident, some boundaries may be determined by political or public ownership. In some cases, conservation buffers around the IBA boundary were also delineated to protect the habitat value of the IBA. Preliminary IBA boundaries were based on the original site description provided in the initial nomination. The GIS model incorporated preliminary boundaries, habitat data from the NJ Department of Environmental Protection's (NJDEP) Endangered and Nongame Species Program (ENSP) Landscape Project Versions 2.1 and 3.0 (http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/ensp/landscape/index.htm), the NJAS Habitat Analysis, as well as site information and bird data provided in the initial nomination. In addition, GIS data of NJDEP's 2002 Land use/Land cover, land ownership records and New Jersey roads and streams data from the NJDEP and the NJ Department of Transportation were used where appropriate. These data were analyzed within the GIS model applying conservation biology principles. Draft boundaries were then modified by IBBA Program staff using various geo-spatial data sets to correct overlapping boundaries, isolated polygons and geometry. Final boundaries were reviewed and approved by members of the IBBA Program Technical Committee. As stated in this metadata record's Use Constraints section, NJAS makes no representations of any kind, including, but not limited to, the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, nor are any such warranties to be implied with respect to the digital data layers furnished hereunder.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census 2000. The Census Bureau creates ZCTAs for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the 2010 Census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. For the 2010 Census, ZCTAs should more accurately represent the actual ZIP Codes at the time of their delineation than they did for Census 2000. This is because that before the tabulation blocks, which the ZCTAs are built from, were delineated for the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau undertook the process of inserting lines that could be used as 2010 Census tabulation block boundaries, and these lines split polygons where the result would be that a significant number of addresses would occur on either one or both sides of the line associated with a single ZIP Code. Each 2010 Census tabulation block that contains addresses is assigned to a single ZCTA, usually to the ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block. As a result, ZIP Codes associated with address ranges found in the Address Ranges relationship file may not always match the ZCTA. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are completely surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. A ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks were it exists. The Census Bureau uses the addresses stored within MTDB to delineate ZCTAs, and at the time of the 2010 Census the MTDB primarily included addresses for residential or at least potentially residential structures, so ZCTAs representing only non-residential structures are infrequent. Also, in each tabulation block, if a choice existed between using a potential city-style mail delivery ZIP Code for an address or a post office box ZIP Code, the city-style mail delivery ZIP Code was preferred for the 2010 Census ZCTA delineation. The Census Bureau identifies 5-digit ZCTAs using a five-character numeric code that represents the most frequently occurring USPS ZIP Code within that ZCTA, and this code may contain leading zeros.","In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.","The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.","In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.","The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.","In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.","The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population.

Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census. A block may consist of one or more faces.","In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.","The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

DEMOGRAPHICS,ZCTA_2010,Census_Geographies_DVRPC,Polygon,"ZIP Code Tabulation Areas, 2010 (TIGER)",,"Subset for DVPRC Region The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census 2000. The Census Bureau creates ZCTAs for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the 2010 Census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. For the 2010 Census, ZCTAs should more accurately represent the actual ZIP Codes at the time of their delineation than they did for Census 2000. This is because that before the tabulation blocks, which the ZCTAs are built from, were delineated for the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau undertook the process of inserting lines that could be used as 2010 Census tabulation block boundaries, and these lines split polygons where the result would be that a significant number of addresses would occur on either one or both sides of the line associated with a single ZIP Code. Each 2010 Census tabulation block that contains addresses is assigned to a single ZCTA, usually to the ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block. As a result, ZIP Codes associated with address ranges found in the Address Ranges relationship file may not always match the ZCTA. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are completely surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. A ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks were it exists. The Census Bureau uses the addresses stored within MTDB to delineate ZCTAs, and at the time of the 2010 Census the MTDB primarily included addresses for residential or at least potentially residential structures, so ZCTAs representing only non-residential structures are infrequent. Also, in each tabulation block, if a choice existed between using a potential city-style mail delivery ZIP Code for an address or a post office box ZIP Code, the city-style mail delivery ZIP Code was preferred for the 2010 Census ZCTA delineation. The Census Bureau identifies 5-digit ZCTAs using a five-character numeric code that represents the most frequently occurring USPS ZIP Code within that ZCTA, and this code may contain leading zeros.","In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.","The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.","ACS Profiles, 5 year data, 2010-2014 for Tracts in DVRPC Region.

DEMOGRAPHICS,IPD,DVRPC_Demographics,Polygon,Environmental Justice: 2012 Tract-level Indicators of Potential Disadvantage for the DVRPC Region,,"2012 Tract-level Indicators of Potential Disadvantage for the DVRPC Region, compiled for the Enviornmental Justice reports.Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Executive Order on Environmental Justice (#12898) do not provide specific guidance to evaluate EJ issues within a region's transportation planning process. Therefore, MPOs must devise their own methods for ensuring that EJ issues are investigated and evaluated in transportation decision-making. In 2001, DVRPC developed an EJ technical assessment to identify direct and disparate impacts of its plans, programs, and planning process on defined population groups in the Delaware Valley region. This assessment, called the Degrees of Disadvantage (DoD) Methodology, is utilized in a variety of DVRPC plans and programs. DVRPC currently assesses the following population groups, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau:Non-Hispanic MinorityCarless HouseholdsHouseholds in PovertyFemale Head of Household with ChildElderly (over 75 years)HispanicLimited English ProficiencyPersons with Physical DisabilitiesUsing U.S. Census American Community Survey data, the population groups listed above are identified and located at the census tract level. Data is gathered at the regional level, combining populations from each of the nine counties, for either individuals or households, depending on the indicator. From there, the total number of persons in each demographic group is divided by the appropriate universe (either population or households) for the nine-county region, providing a regional average for that population group. Any census tract that meets or exceeds the regional average level, or threshold, is considered an EJ-sensitive tract for that group.Census tables used to gather data from the 2009 - 2012 American Community Survey 5-Year EstimatesUniverse: PopulationTotal PopulationElderly (over 75 years)B01001_Elderly% Elderly (over 75 years)Elderly ThresholdNon-Hispanic MinorityB03002_Non-Hispanic Minority% Non-Hispanic MinorityNon-Hispanic Minority ThresholdHispanic or LatinoB03003_Hispanic% Hispanic or LatinoHispanic or Latino ThresholdPersons with Physical DisabilitiesB18101_Disability% Persons with Physical DisabilitiesPersons with Physical Disabilities ThresholdUniverse: HouseholdsTotal HouseholdsFemale Head of Household with ChildB11005_FemHoHwithChild% Female Head of Household with ChildFemale Head of Household with Child ThresholdHouseholds in PovertyB17017_HHinPov% Households in PovertyHouseholds in Poverty ThresholdCarless HouseholdsB25044_CarlessHH% Carless HouseholdsCarless Households ThresholdUniverse: Population, 5 years and olderPopulation 5yrs+Limited English ProficiencyB16004_LimitedEngProf% Limited English ProficiencyLimited English Proficiency ThresholdFor more information and for methodology, visit DVRPC's website:http://www.dvrpc.org/GetInvolved/TitleVI/Source of tract boundaries: US Census Bureau.

﻿ENVIRONMENT,NJ_KnownContaminatedSites,Contaminated_Sites,Point,ENVIRONMENT.NJ_KnownContaminatedSites,"Stefanoni, Joe","The Known Contaminated Sites List (KCSNJ) for New Jersey (Non-Homeowner) are those non-homeowner sites and properties within the state where contamination of soil or ground water has been confirmed at levels equal to or greater than applicable standards. This list of Known Contaminated Sites may include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated or has been completed. While quarterly revisions will be made, it is important to note that this GIS posting is ""static"" and does not perfectly reflect the ""live"" KCSNJ as new sites are added and old sites removed between updates. A ""live"" KSCNJ report can be viewed via Data Miner at: http://datamine2.state.nj.us/DEP_OPRA/OpraMain/categories?category=Site+Case+sub-category . Homeowner sites generally involve small heating oil discharges that are resolved within months, making their inclusion in the GIS posting likely to be inaccurate and unduly alarming. They were removed from the quarterly GIS report but remain on the tabular report at: http://www.state.nj.us/dep/srp/kcsnj/kcsnj_active.pdf or http://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/kcsnj/kcsnj_active.xls A small number of sites in the live KCSL have no X/Y coordinates as of this date and therefore are not included in the GIS version. These sites do appear on the above in the tabular reports. Coordinates for the GIS version of the KSCL are largely ""front door"" locations acquired via ""address matching"" or which is an approximation of the facility front door. Many of these locations were also gathered by the Department using GPS and although these tend to be much more accurate, mistakes are sometimes made. Since errors can occur, users are encouraged to notify BIS of any these or any other inaccuracies in the KCSNJ.

Sites are sampled in every Watershed Management Area (WMA) in the State. Historically, the New Jersey Impairment Score (NJIS), based on family level taxonomy, was used for the entire state to make assessments at three levels of impairment; non-impaired, moderately impaired, and severely impaired. Indices were developed, based on genus level taxonomy and grouped into three distinct geographical regions: high gradient (above the Fall Line), low gradient (Coastal Plain excluding the Pinelands), and Pinelands (the boundary of the Pinelands National Reserve plus a 5-km buffer). These indices are called High Gradient Macroinvertebrate Index (HGMI), Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (CPMI), and the Pinelands Macroinvertebrate Index (PMI). These indices replace the NJIS and offer a greater level of resolution using four levels of assessment; excellent, good, fair, and poor. Round 1 data has been assessed using NJIS, while all subsequent rounds are assessed using the HGMI, CPMI, or PMI.**Downloaded April 2015**","In 1992, NJDEP reactivated its Ambient Biomonitoring Network (AMNET) to support its Statewide Water Quality Inventory [305(b)], Impaired Waters [303(d)], and Watershed Programs. Under the program, sites in each of New Jersey's five Water Regions are sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates on a rotating schedule (once every five years). To date, the third round of sampling has been completed for all Water Regions. The results of the program have been incorporated into New Jersey's Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement (NEPPS) with USEPA as a primary environmental indicator of water quality impairment.","New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Data Use and Distribution Agreement I.

GEOLOGY,PA_Bedrock_Geology,Geology,Polygon,GEOLOGY.PA_Bedrock_Geology,Christine E. Miles,"Two digital data sets, one for geologic units and faults and the other for dikes, have been prepared for Pennsylvania. The data sets were digitized primarily from the artwork used for the 1980 ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg, T. M., Edmunds, W. E., Geyer, A. R., and others, compilers, 1980, Geologic map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 1, scale 1:250,000) and from source materials used for that map. Many of the source materials had been published as page-sized maps and were digitized from this published paper copy (Berg, T. M., and Dodge, C. M., 1981, Atlas of preliminary geologic quadrangle maps of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geological Survey, 4th ser., Map 61, scale approx. 1:62,500). The other source materials consist of unpublished and published maps at various scales. It was beyond the scope of the project to incorporate revisions that had been made to the geologic units since the 1980 map was compiled; however, some updates to formational contacts, faults, and dikes, as well as to geologic nomenclature and ages, were incorporated where the revisions could be easily made. The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:250,000. The polygon attributes in the data set for geologic contacts and faults include unit number, map symbol, name, age, and three lithology categories that represent the general lithologic makeup of each geologic unit. Each arc (line) in the data set is attributed as one or more of the three general categories of contact, fault, or border. Contact lines are attributed according to the type of contact shown on the 1980 map (solid, dashed, queried, or arbitrary). Fault lines are similarly attributed (solid, dashed, or queried). Borders are attributed as either state boundaries, quadrangle boundaries, or the shoreline of Lake Erie. The data set for dikes consists of arcs attributed with unit number, map symbol, name, age, lithology, and type of dike (solid or dashed). It is anticipated that the digital data sets will be used for a variety of regional or statewide geographic-information-system applications, including water-resource and environmental studies, conservation and ecosystem management, mineral exploration, and regional land use planning and development.","The hard-copy ""Geologic Map of Pennsylvania"" (Berg and others, 1980) is the most current, available source showing the bedrock geology of the entire state and has had widespread use for regional studies. The Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey (PaGS), responding to numerous requests from federal and state government agencies and the private sector, has converted the geology represented on the 1980 map to a digital format. The purpose is to make the geology of the state available as a ""seamless"" coverage for use in regional spatial analyses and other digital applications.","The data for the geologic units, faults, and dikes may be used provided that credit for the original (unaltered) data sets is given to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Users shall clearly indicate the source of the data. Users who modify the data in any way are obligated to describe the types of modifications they have made, including modifications to hard-copy maps. Users are not to misrepresent Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey (PaGS) data sets, nor to imply that changes they (users) have made were approved by the PaGS. These data sets are not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting and siting decisions.

Federal, state, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey any authority for the decisions they make using these data sets.  The geologic units depicted on the published map are, in many cases, taken from source maps that were based on aerial photograph interpretation and limited, or no, field checking. Users are cautioned that, because of the nature and scale of the compilation and the source materials used, the geologic contacts, faults, and dikes may be off their true locations by several hundred feet locally. Users are also cautioned that, because the lithologies of many geologic units vary widely both laterally and vertically, the representation of the lithology of the geologic units based only on the dominant lithology (LITH1 in the polygon attribute table) is in many cases inappropriate, even at a regional scale.  The data sets are not meant for site-specific analysis or for use at finer (i.e., larger, more detailed) scales. Users are not to misrepresent the data sets by presenting them at scales for which they are not intended, nor to imply that presentation at such scales is approved by the PaGS.

HYDROGRAPHY,NJDEP_HUC_14,Watersheds,Polygon,HYDROGRAPHY.NJDEP_HUC_14,Jeffrey L. Hoffman,"The 14-digit hydrologic units (HUC14s) in New Jersey is a revision of the 2006 version of these units. This version corrects some boundaries to be consistent with a new hydrography coverage based on 1:2,400 aerial photographs (NJDEP, 2008). It also makes some changes to be more consistent with a new 12-digit hydrologic unit coverage (EPA, 2009). This editing process created 42 new HUC14s, deleted one inland HUC14 and five coastal HUC14s in the Delaware Bay, and changed over 100 boundaries. A report detailing these changes (Hoffman and Pallis, 2009) is available online . For programmatic reasons the 14-digit units are clipped to New Jersey's political boundary. HUC14 hydrologic units were first published by Ellis and Price (1995) and made available as a shape file by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection soon afterword. Watershed boundaries were based on elevations and water courses from 1:24,000-scale (7.5-minute) USGS quadrangles. These were revised (NJDEP, 2006) by clipping the unit boundaries to the official NJ state boundary and addition of some additional identification information. Some boundaries were changed at that time to reflect errors found in the original coverage. This product is an interim product and will be replaced once better elevational data are available. It is based on elevational data from quadrangle maps at a scale of 1:24,000. The hydrography is at 1:2,400. Once high-resolution LiDAR data (at 1:2,400 or better) become available for New Jersey the 14-digit hydrologic units will be redrawn and this interim coverage will be replaced. EPA's 12-digit hydrologic system (USEPA, 2009) uses a numbering convention that is not entirely consistent with the 14-digit numbering system. For some HUC14s, the first 12 digits do not match the identification number of the 12-digit hydrologic unit it lies within. These discrepancies will be corrected when the HUC14s are next revised.",This coverage defines hydrologic units for New Jersey. It is designed to identify the area which drains to a point of interest. It can be used as a starting point to delineate a study area with a drainage basin boundary.,"This data is not field-checked and comes with no guarantees as to its accuracy.

HYDROGRAPHY,NJDEP_HUC_11,Watersheds,Polygon,HYDROGRAPHY.NJDEP_HUC_11,Jeffrey L. Hoffman,"Drainage basins are delineated from 1:24,000-scale (7.5-minute) USGS quadrangles. The delineations have been developed for general purpose use by USGS District staff over the past 20 years. Arc and polygon attributes have been included in the coverage with basin names and ranks of divides, and 14-digit hydrologic unit codes. The New Jersey state boundary as originally defined in the USGS source coverage does not match that used by the NJDEP. Therefore the coverage was edited by the NJ Geological Survey to remove the USGS state boundary and insert the NJDEP state boundary, thus resolving most potential clipping errors. Note: Some information in this metadata describes the DEPHUC 14 coverage instead of the DEPHUC 11 because DEPHUC 14 is more detailed. Most processes and procedures used are identical for both coverages.","The DEPHUC ""14"" coverage can be used as a starting point to delineate a study area with a drainage basin boundary. Delineations starting from most major data collection stations and named streams are included.

HYDROGRAPHY,PADEP_Stormwater,Watersheds,Polygon,DEP designated stormwater management watersheds,Durla Lathia,This shapefile represents the polygon locations and data for DEP designated stormwater management watersheds.,"Stormwater management involves the control of water that runs off the surface of the land from rain or melting ice or snow. The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code.",No variable,"inlandWaters, stormwater, storm water, storm, water, rain, ice, snow, runoff, impervious, Storm Water Management Act, 167, watershed, watersheds, drainage",20150414,375

PARCELS,Camden_Parcels,Camden,Polygon,PARCELS.Camden_Parcels,,"This parcels data set is a spatial representation of municipal tax lots for Camden County, New Jersey. The data set was updated and normalized between 2009 - 2011 as a component of the New Jersey Office of Information Technology, Office of GIS (OGIS) Parcels Normalization Project to develop a statewide composite of parcels data. During this project, parcels were modified at municipal boundaries to conform to the spatial framework of the OGIS Municipalities of New Jersey (nj_munis) data set, and attributes were modified to conform with the New Jersey GIS Parcel Mapping Standard. Each parcel contains a unique identifier based on a county/municipality code, block number, lot number and qualification code. Using the unique identifier, the data set can be joined to MOD-IV database tables that contain supplementary attribute information regarding lot ownership and characteristics. Due to irregularities in the data development process, duplicate PAMS_PIN values exist in the parcel records. Users should avoid joining MOD-IV database table records to all parcel records with duplicate PAMS_PINs because of uncertainty regarding whether the MOD-IV records will join to the correct parcel records. There are also parcel records with unique PAMS_PINs for which there are no corresponding records in MOD-IV database tables. This is mostly due to the way data are organized in the MOD-IV database. Parcels are not survey data and should not be used as such. The polygons delineated in this data set do not represent legal boundaries and should not be used to provide a legal determination of land ownership.**Downloaded March 2014 - MODIV data was downloaded in April 2014 and appended to the original shapefile. Several edits were made to the parcels where there duplicate blocks and lots within the same MCD. If edits were made, notes can be found in ""GIS_Notes""**","Parcels are a key framework data set for Camden County Improvement Authority's GIS spatial data network which serves the Improvement Authority's information management system.

PARCELS,Burlington_Parcels,Burlington,Polygon,PARCELS.Burlington_Parcels,Merrilee J. Torres,"**DOWNLOADED SEPT 2012** This GIS data set contains parcels created by the Burlington County Department of Information Technology (BCDIT) and the New Jersey Pinelands Comission (NJPC) for Burlington County, New Jersey. The BCDIT data consist of parcels mapped on municipal tax maps for the non-Pinelands portion of Burlington County. This includes the following townships outside of the Pinelands: Beverly City, Bordentown City, Bordentown Township, Burlington City, Burlington Township, Chesterfield, Cinnaminson, Delanco, Delran, Eastampton, Edgewater Park, Florence, Fieldsboro, Hainesport, Lumberton, Mansfield, Maple Shade, Moorestown, Mount Holly, Mount Laurel, Palmyra, Pemberton Borough, Riverton, Riverside, Springfield, Westampton and Willingboro. This also includes the non-Pinelands portions of the following towns: Evesham, Medford, New Hanover, Pemberton Township, Southampton and Wrightstown. The original data were developed in-house between 1996-2000. Between 2000-2008 the data were updated in-house in various years on a municipality by municipality basis. In 2009 the Mount Laurel data were updated by a consultant working for the township. The NJPC data consist of parcels mapped on municipal tax maps within the New Jersey Pinelands area. The municipalities include Bass River Twp, Evesham Twp, Medford Twp, Medford Lakes Twp, New Hanover Twp, North Hanover Twp, Pemberton Twp, Shamong Twp, Southampton Twp, Springfield Twp, Tabernacle Twp, Washington Twp and Woodland Twp. The original data, created in 2001, were a compilation of parcel data acquired from municipal and county sources and parcel data created for the NJPC by BAE Systems ADR for those areas where parcels data did not exist. The data were updated in 2006 and 2009. During the 2009 update Bass River Twp was developed in-house and integrated into the NJPC data set. The 2009, the NJPC parcels were integrated into the BCDIT countywide data set during the New Jersey Office of Information Technology, Office of GIS Parcels Normalization Project to develop a statewide composite of parcel data sets. Updates continue to be made as necessary.","This dataset serves as part of the foundation of Burlington County's continuing spatial data network and will help form a resource from which many County organizations can draw benefit. Such benefits include Megan's Law Notification mapping, Farmland and Open Space assessments, maps for trials, property specific wetland and soil analysis, geocoding of animal shelter intakes and other address based information, planning and incorporation into the County's Pictometry Online application. This parcel data set provides the NJPC with the spatial property information data needed for regional land use analysis with respect to land acquisition proposals, management area changes, rezoning, letters of interpretation, density transfers, enforcement issues, Long Term Economic Monitoring (LTEM) and watershed analysis. The data set also serves as the base for various other GIS layers such as zoning and management area data.","For all data contained herein, Burlington County makes no representations of any kind, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, nor are any such warranties to be implied, with respect to the digital data layers furnished hereunder.
