The global biodiversity significance ranks range from B1 to B5.  Within the Highlands Region the global biodiversity significance rank has been combined with a state biodiversity significance rank which provides information about the significance of the site on a state level.  The state biodiversity significance ranks for sites in the Highlands Region range from V1 to V5.

STRUCTURES,NJ_FireSta,Point,ADDRESS2,CITY,String,"Location within physical address, e.g., floor, suite, building."
STRUCTURES,NJ_FireSta,Point,CITY,STATE,String,"
The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a ""city"" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as ""undeliverable""). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having ""General Delivery"". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not ""general delivery""). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the ""city"" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the ""city"" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable ""city"" to the USPS. An example of this is ""Notre Dame, IN"". There is no city in Indiana called ""Notre Dame"", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. ""Notre Dame"", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS ""city"" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable ""city"" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a ""city"" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as ""undeliverable""). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having ""General Delivery"". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not ""general delivery""). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the ""city"" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the ""city"" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable ""city"" to the USPS. An example of this is ""Notre Dame, IN"". There is no city in Indiana called ""Notre Dame"", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. ""Notre Dame"", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS ""city"" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable ""city"" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

The ORI is a nine-character identifier assigned by FBI CJIS staff to an agency which has met the established qualifying criteria for ORI assignment to identify the agency in transactions on the NCIC 2000 System. The structure of law enforcement ORIs (those ORIs ending with a zero) and other criminal justice ORIs (those ORIs ending with an alphabetic character) are as follows:

1. POSITIONS 1 THROUGH 5>Positions 1 and 2 are the alphabetic characters representing the state or country in which the agency is located.
For example: PA0040100
Positions 3, 4, and 5 are numeric characters indicating the county in which the agency is located.
For example: PA0040100
Exceptions to this are some state-level and federal agencies, which have the acronym for that agency, or alphabetic variations thereof, in positions 3, 4, and 5, i.e., DCATF0000 and TXDPD0000 for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Dallas, Texas, Police Department, respectively.

2. POSITIONS 6 THROUGH 9 OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ORIs
The criterion FBI CJIS staff uses for assigning a law enforcement ORI (one ending with a zero) is that the agency is a governmental agency or subunit thereof having statutory power of arrest and whose primary function is that of apprehension and detection.
Positions 6 and 7 in a law enforcement ORI are used to distinguish one agency from another within the same county.
For example: PA0040100
Positions 8 and 9 of a law enforcement ORI are always double zero. NCIC 2000 users, particularly large city/urban police departments, may vary the last two positions (8 and 9) to identify internal divisions, units, substations, or multiple terminals for the same agency within the same city. Any variation of the last two positions is acceptable with the exception that an alphabetic character cannot be used in position 9. NCIC 2000 does not assign these variations. The variations will not translate when a ZO inquiry is made.

3. POSITIONS 6 THROUGH 9 OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE ORIs
FBI CJIS staff determines the numeric and alphabetic characters assigned to positions 6 through 9 for criminal justice ORIs as follows: Positions 6 and 7 are numeric characters uniquely distinguishing one agency from other agencies of the same type and level within the same county. They do not indicate location (e.g., city) of the agency.
For example: PA004023C
Position 8 is a unique numeric character indicating the government level of the agency:
1 - Local, Municipal, City
3 - County
5 - State
7 - Federal
9 - Nongovernmental
For example: PA004023C
Position 9 is an alphabetic character representing the type of agency:
A - Prosecuting Attorney's Offices (includes District Attorney's Offices, Attorney General's Offices,  etc.).
B - Pretrial service agencies and pretrial release agencies.
C - Correctional Institutions (includes jails, prisons, detention centers, etc.).
D - Civil Courts for use in domestic violence and stalking cases.
E - Nongovernmental railroad or campus police departments qualifying for access to III. (This section  provides criteria for assignment of a limited access ORI.)
G - Probation and Parole Offices.
H - Department of State National Visa Center.
I - INTERPOL.
J - Courts and Magistrates Offices.
K - Medical examiners and coroners offices for access to Missing Person and Unidentified Person Files.
M - Custodial facilities in medical or psychiatric institutions and some medical examiners' offices which are criminal justice in function.
N - Regional dispatch centers which are criminal justice agencies or under the management control of criminal justice agencies.
O - National Insurance Crime Bureau.
P - Nongovernmental agencies that qualify for access to some NCIC 2000 files other than III. Also, 911 centers that do not have a management control agreement.
Q - Department of Housing and Urban Development approved Public Housing Agencies.
R - Agencies authorized by Public Law 99-169 for national security purposes.
U - Federal and state governmental child support enforcement agencies.
V - Department of Motor Vehicles.
W - National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).
Y - Local, county, state, or federal agencies that are classified as criminal justice agencies by statute but do not fall into one of the aforementioned categories, e.g., Arkansas Crime Information Center.
For example: PA004023C
